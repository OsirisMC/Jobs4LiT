So...

I managed to pull out the filter with Seniority and Contingency but failed on using Perks and Location on time 
Order by and search with Key words functions are also missing
And finally the Similar job function on Job Details works perfectly as expected it takes Functional Area as filter for that 

I used HTML CSS and JS on this project cause they are what i am more familiar to.

I focused on pulling out the functions instead of design but its not too far away from the Figma

I placed an aditional button Reload to reload the Job board after you use a filter.

I feel like this aprouchment is like 60-70% of the full project cause i am missing Figma Fidelity and 4 functions ( Filters and Order by as mentioned )
Anyways i know i could ve pulled out the Perk and Location filter with a bit more time but i admit i ve no clue on how to pull out the Keyword filter and the order by 

But i am still proud of my job here, i really dont know if i am going to pass the test but i am happy anyways cause i found a lot of information and better ways to use JS that ive never heard 
about while doing this project and i am really hype about exposing it soon

Thanks for reading, Ivan <3
